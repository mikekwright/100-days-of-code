### Day 0: June 13, 2018  

**Today's Focus**: Committing to 100 days of coding and coming up with a plan. 

**Details**:

Today I received an email from [codingame.com](https://www.codingame.com/) that contained an article with
an interesting idea and one that I had not come across.  Namely it was about doing a challenge called
the #100DaysOfCode in which you would commit to spending 1 hour a day improving your coding abilities.  

[The article](https://www.codingame.com/blog/100-days-of-code-challenge) was written by 
[Jason Down](https://twitter.com/jasondown) who shared an overview of his experiences as well as tools
that he used to complete the challenge.  I was inspired and spent a bit of time looking more into
the [#100DaysOfX](http://100daysofx.com/) which gave more details around to challenge and
other potential challenges that I am going to participate in concurrently.  

With all that in place I want to layout some ideas, topics and potential projects that I may spend some of 
my time over the next 100 days.  

- Work towards completing the [DataQuest](https://www.dataquest.io/) "Data Scientist in Python Path"
- Create simple sample ML project using NLP and Scala
- Build a unity or godot game to use as engine for reinforcement learning
- Build webapp using Elm/Elixir (Trying to decide purpose of webapp)
- Increase language skills for golang, kotlin, erlang or julia
- Complete more challenges at [codingame](https://www.codingame.com/), [hackerrank](https://www.hackerrank.com) or [exercism.io](http://exercism.io)

I am very excited to have a reason to start the challenge and to help myself grow.  Let's see what the future
holds.  

__NOTE__: I wonder if the summer was a bad time to start get started with vacations and camping... let's hope I
can find a wifi signal ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯

### Day 1: June 14, 2018

**Today's Focus**: In order to help me get setup and ready to go through the Scala ML problem I decided
to have a quick refresher on Scala by reading docs and going through codingame problem.  

**Details**:  The problem that I worked on was a simple one, [Chuck Norris](https://www.codingame.com/training/easy/chuck-norris),
but it was a good refresher to see how I could solve it with immutability and functional programming.  The main
programming concepts that I went through.  

 - Tuples
 - Annonymous functions and the `_` symbol
 - Type conversion (char, num, string, etc)

Now I need to focus on getting the scala notebook running on my machine so that I can use it to document the process
and ML solution.
